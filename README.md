# Nearest-Neighbor-Classifier-Performance-Comparison
This project involves developing a program in any desired programming language to compare the performance of the k-nearest neighbor classifier with 1 and 3 nearest neighbors against the performance of the centroid-based classifier. The program will read training and test data from a selected database and evaluate the accuracy of the classifiers.
