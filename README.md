# Project Title

Nearest Neighbor Classifier Performance Comparison

## Project Description

This project involves developing a program in any desired programming language to compare the performance of the k-nearest neighbor classifier with 1 and 3 nearest neighbors against the performance of the centroid-based classifier. The program will read training and test data from a selected database and evaluate the accuracy of the classifiers.

## Features

- Implement a k-nearest neighbor classifier with 1 and 3 nearest neighbors.
- Implement a centroid-based classifier.
- Read training and test data from a chosen database.
- Calculate and compare the performance of the classifiers.
